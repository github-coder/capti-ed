					<p>A common goal for many teachers is to facilitate a student-led learning environment. The more the students are engaged in the material the better the students’ overall understanding of the material. By encouraging students teaching each other, they have the opportunity to explain what they know better than with a purely instructor-led course. In order for this to occur the lessons should be adapted to the needs of the individuals, and the structure and pacing should allow for student reflection and closure.</p>
