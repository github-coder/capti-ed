					<p>Self contained classrooms are designed to enhance specific support for students with more serious special needs that are unable to participate in the general education classroom.  There are a fewer number of students present in the class and each foster unique challenges that are addressed in each student’s IEP. Under the certified special education teacher’s guidance, at least one paraprofessional is present to help provide instructional support.  The placement of the student should be made with the student’s disabilities as well as their best interest in mind.</p>
